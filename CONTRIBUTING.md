# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the sprous repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Test your changes with `yarn test`. Please also add new tests if neccessary
4. Send a pull request from each feature branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows each feature or improvement to be reviewed and merged individually.

## Unit Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage. sprous uses jest and react-testing-library for testing.
